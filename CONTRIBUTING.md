# PistonExploits Contribution Guidelines
This project aims to have the best standards, so you have to follow a few rules before the fun starts!

## Requirements
* Working PC with 4+ GB of ram
* Intellij Idea (Preferably ultimate, but community works too): https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/

Plugins for intellij:
* [google-java-format](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8527-google-java-format)
* [sonarlint](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7973-sonarlint)
* [Lombok](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6317-lombok)
* [Minecraft Development](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8327-minecraft-development)

A good theme: :D
* [One dark theme](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/11938-one-dark-theme) (Simple theme that just looks good)
* [Material Theme UI](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8006-material-theme-ui) (I don't really like it because it has so many corners everywhere)

## Things you need to use
* Enable google java format. Its a requirement!
* Always reformat your code before committing it. (Right click package, "Reformat code", select cleanup code too, run it)
* We love comments and javadocs! <3 Please don't forget to write those. *everywhere possible*
* Java is object-oriented! So don't make stuff static where not needed!
* You MUST fix everything sonarlint tells you before committing, or you make it a draft. We won't merge PRs with issues left!

## FAQ
* Why do you not use bukkit config api? It is bad. eo-yaml is what we use. It allows us to easily write and save comments in yaml.
* Why so strict? We have grown tired of bad code from other "exploit fixers".
* Why sonarlint? Sonarlint is a gem! It has a reason for everything it tells you! Just click onn "see rule".
* Is there a discord? Yes it is my general one here: https://discord.gg/CDrcxzH
